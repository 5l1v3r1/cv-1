abstract = {We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called “seeds,” with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate. In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place, greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time. Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore province of Quadril\'{a}tero Ferr\'{\i}fero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and previous interpretations.},

abstract = {We have developed a new cost-effective method for processing large-potential-field data sets via the equivalent-layer technique. In this approach, the equivalent layer is divided into a regular grid of equivalent-source windows. Inside each window, the physical-property distribution is described by a bivariate polynomial. Hence, the physical-property distribution within the equivalent layer is assumed to be a piecewise polynomial function defined on a set of equivalent-source windows. We perform any linear transformation of a large set of data as follows. First, we estimate the polynomial coefficients of all equivalent- source windows by using a linear regularized inversion. Second, we transform the estimated polynomial coefficients of all windows into the physical-property distribution within the whole equivalent layer. Finally, we premultiply this distribution by the matrix of Green’s functions associated with the desired transformation to obtain the transformed data. The regularized inversion deals with a linear system of equations with dimensions based on the total number of polynomial coefficients within all equivalent-source windows. This contrasts with the classical approach of directly estimating the physical-property distribution within the equivalent layer, which leads to a system based on the number of data. Because the number of data is much larger than the number of polynomial coefficients, the proposed polynomial representation of the physical-property distribution within an equivalent layer drastically reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. By comparing the total number of floating-point operations required to estimate an equivalent layer via our method with the classical approach, both formulated with Cholesky’s decomposition, we can verify that the computation time required for building the linear system and for solving the linear inverse problem can be reduced by as many as three and four orders of magnitude, respectively. Applications to synthetic and real data show that our method performs the standard linear transformations of potential-field data accurately.},

abstract = {We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around user-specified prisms called “seeds”. These seeds have known density contrasts and the solution is constrained to be concentrated around the seeds as well as have their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and geophysical information are incorporated into the inverse problem through the seeds. However, this leads to a strong dependence of the solution on the correct location, density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our improvement to this method consists of using the “shape-of-anomaly” data-misfit function in conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit function. The shape-of-anomaly function measures the different in shape between the observed and predicted data and is insen- sitive to differences in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and real data show that the improved method not only has an increased robustness with respect to the number of seeds and their locations, but also provides a better fit of the observed data.},

abstract = {The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new calculation methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth. We address this problem by using a discretization with a series of tesseroids. There is no closed formula giving the gravitational fields of the tesseroid and numerical integration methods must be used, such as the Gauss Legendre Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the computation times with the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is important to optimize the computations while maintaining the desired accuracy. This optimization was done using an adaptive computation scheme that consists of using a fixed GLC order and recursively subdividing the tesseroids. We have obtained an optimum ratio between the size of the tesseroid and its distance from the computation point. Furthermore, we show that this size-to-distance ratio is different for the gravitational attraction than for the gravity gradient tensor.},
