# Curriculum Vitae

These are the Latex sources for my academic CV.

Compiled PDF versions for each update are available at
https://github.com/leouieda/cv/releases

I made my own clean template this time after using `moderncv` for a while.
It was also a chance for me to learn some Latex templating (and procrastihack a
little).
You're free to reuse and modify this template under the terms of the BSD
3-clause License (see `LICENSE.txt`).

Compiled using XeLaTex. More information on the `.tex` source file.

I highly recommend using the `Makefile` to build the PDF by running:

    make

Use `make clean` to remove all generated files.
